**Heart Disease Prediction**



This project is a web application developed using Streamlit for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on multiple clinical features. The app leverages several machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Additionally, the application provides a bulk prediction feature using CSV files and visualizes model accuracies and F1 Scores for performance comparison.

✅ Features:
Single Prediction: Input patient data and receive predictions from multiple ML models.

Bulk Prediction: Upload a CSV file with multiple records for batch prediction.

Model Performance Analysis: Visualize model accuracies and F1 Scores through interactive charts.

Data Visualization: Bar chart for accuracies and line chart for F1 Scores.

Downloadable Results: Export prediction results as a CSV file.

✅ Data Inputs:
Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure, Serum Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar

Resting ECG, Maximum Heart Rate Achieved, Exercise-Induced Angina

ST Depression (Oldpeak), Slope of ST Segment

✅ Dependencies:
Streamlit
